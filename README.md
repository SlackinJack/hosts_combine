# hosts_combine

**Working: Most likely**


A simple bash script to download, combine, deduplicate/clean, and install hosts to /etc, from a list of sources.


## Usage:
- Edit sources.txt with your list of hosts sources (some are already included as an example).
- Run the script using ./hosts_combine.sh
- If you wish to install hosts to /etc, then provide root privilege when asked.
